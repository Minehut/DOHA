# Database Of Hacked Accounts

Nowadays, people cheat a lot in Minecraft. As they want to play more and cheat even more, websites
like MCLeaks provides Minecraft accounts for free. This is a problem: it means a cheater is able to
reconnect indefinitely to a server—maybe your own!—and continue to cheat. Even if these services are
totally legal because they run with thousands of accounts given by their respective owners, the question
is, should we tolerate this and accept these players, or do we have to ban them to protect ourselves
against the cheaters using these services?
